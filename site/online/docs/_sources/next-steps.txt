Next Steps
==========

Geraldo Reports is a ambicious project. We want to reach much more than we did.
See below the main goals we have to do in the future (and maybe you could help
us to reach them early)

Engine API
----------

* **Table band** - a band to make easy create lists just using tables instead
  of detail band and lines. Table band must be an alternative to detail band
* Support canvas draw
* Report merging (many reports at once)
* Events (i.e: BeforePrint and AfterPrint for bands and reports)

Generators
----------

* **Generate in ODF formats (ODT and ODS) (currently in development)**
* Generate in HTML and maybe to TXT
* Export/import structure to/from a XMLized format

Thir-part tools
---------------

* Have a GUI tool to design reports, if possible to be used in a web browser
* Have a way to create and print reports using a server, with no low level coding
* **Django pluggable application to create fast reports** (currently in development)
