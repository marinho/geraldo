Installation
============

Geraldo is still not available as installer or system package. So, you have two
ways to install it:

Option 1. Get the latest official version
-----------------------------------------

1. Get the latest tarball available from:

    https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=251460&package_id=307400
    
2. Then you can do the following steps to install it:

**Linux**

::
    
    tar xvfz geraldo-latest.tar.gz
    cd geraldo
    sudo python setup.py install

This will copy Geraldo's packages inside Python packages path.

**Windows**

If you are using Windows, Geraldo is fully compatible. You just have to use a
tarball uncompress tool, like **7-Zip** you can download from:

    http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
    

Once you have a tool to uncompress tarball files, you have to uncompress it,
open a MS-DOS Prompty window in the folder you uncompress into and run the
following command:

::

    python setup.py install
    

Option 2. Get the latest development version
--------------------------------------------

Our version control is centralized on GitHub Social repository, in the
following URL:

::

    http://github.com/marinho/geraldo
    

To get the latest development version from repository server, you will need for
Git version control system. Then you can run the following command in Shell or
MS-DOS Prompty window:

::

    git clone git://github.com/marinho/geraldo.git
    

A folder named **geraldo** will be in your current path with all
Geraldo files inside.

Then you can go ahead and use the same commands from **Option 1** to install
in your system.

Dependencies
------------

**ReportLab**

This is required, there is no chance you use Geraldo with no ReportLab
installed.

Get it from the following URL:

    http://www.reportlab.org/
    

The tested version is **2.1**.

**Python Imaging Library**

Geraldo depends on PIL for works with Images manipulation on the canvas. If you
aren't going to use them, you can live without PIL.
